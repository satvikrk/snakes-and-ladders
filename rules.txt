1. The timer starts as soon as the game begins. (Timer on screen is indicative, more accurate timekeeping is done at the system level to ensure fair scores.)
2. A question is displayed to the user if they land on a snake or ladder. If the user fails to answer a snake question, they are bitten by the snake and are moved back a few spaces. If the user answers a ladder question successfully, they are allowed to climb up the ladder and thereby advance a few spaces.
3. If the player answers incorrectly or passes a question, 20 seconds are added to their total time.
4. The player to complete the game in the least time is ranked first on the leaderboard, which is arranged in ascending order of times taken.
